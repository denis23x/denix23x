# How to use SVG Sprite Icons for development

## Contents

# Intro

[wiki/Texture_atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas)

In computer graphics, a texture atlas (*also called a spritesheet or an image sprite in 2D game development*) is an image containing multiple smaller images, usually packed together to reduce overall dimensions. An atlas can consist of uniformly-sized images or images of varying dimensions. A sub-image is drawn using custom texture coordinates to pick it out of the atlas.

In web development, an SVG sprite is a collection of SVG icons or graphics bundled together in a single SVG file. Each graphic within the sprite can be referenced individually, allowing for efficient use of SVG graphics on a website. SVG sprites are particularly popular for icons, logos, and other small graphics that can be reused across a site.

# NPM Packages

We will need to install a few node packages:

- [svg2sprite-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg2sprite-cli)
- [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
- [prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompts)
- [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)

All of this (and types!) can be installed with one following command, where `-D` it's `--save-dev` so donâ€™t worry about production build.

``` bash
npm i svg2sprite-cli prettier prompts @types/prompts jsdom @types/jsdom -D
```

We actually only need one package, but we'll be cool developers and install them all, read on to find out why.

# SVG Icons

Let's download a set of icons for the sprite, I prefer to use [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)

After getting icons arrange files something like this:

``` mdx
assets/
â””â”€â”€ icons/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ban.svg
    â”œâ”€â”€ bookmark.svg
    â””â”€â”€ ...
sprite.js
```

Now it's a time to use already installed packages ðŸ”¥

## Making Sprite

Here is the simple script below where we using **prompts** and **svg2sprite-cli**

- **prompts** package is responsible for command line interaction with the user, we will use only select as an prompt type, there are a lot of additional types and you can read about all of them in the [documentation](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts?tab=readme-ov-file#-types)
- **svg2sprite-cli** we will use this package to create a sprite, just pass the input and output values to it, add extra parameters like `--stripAttrs` if needed, again, if you are interested, read the [documentation](https://github.com/mrmlnc/svg2sprite-cli#readme)

You can add more than one of choices to have a multiple sprites:

``` javascript {12-14}
import prompts from 'prompts';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

(async () => {
	const sprite = await prompts({
		type: 'select',
		name: 'sprite',
		message: 'Select a sprite',
		initial: 0,
		choices: [
			{
				title: 'Bootstrap',
				value: 'bootstrap',
				description: 'Build sprite of Bootstrap icons'
			}
		]
	});

	if (sprite.sprite === 'bootstrap') {
		const run = spawn('svg2sprite ./assets/icons ./assets/sprite-bootstrap.svg --inline', {
			shell: true,
			stdio: 'inherit'
		});
	} else {
		console.log('Ok, Bye!');
	}
})();
```

Now you can run this script with `node sprite` and you will see a select CLI input from the **prompts** package, by selecting the appropriate item your sprite will be assembled âœ…

## Update index.html

Now need to inject it to the project into `index.html` with help of **jsdom** and **prettier**

Here is the **index.html** example below, pay attention to `data-sprite="bootstrap"` this is the element where our sprite will appear:

``` html {12}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
		<title>Sprite</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<div class="hidden" data-sprite="bootstrap"></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

Let's update **sprite.js** script with the next code:

- **jsdom** this package will be used to work with **DOM** and insert sprite into **index.html**
- **prettier** this package will be used for text formatting

``` javascript {8}
run.on('close', () => {
	fs.readFile('./assets/sprite-bootstrap.svg', 'utf8', (error, sprite) => {
		if (error) {
			throw error;
		}

		jsdom.JSDOM.fromFile('./index.html').then((dom) => {
			const selector = "[data-sprite='bootstrap']";

			dom.window.document.querySelector(selector).innerHTML = sprite.trim();

			fs.writeFile('./index.html', dom.serialize(), (error) => {
				if (error) {
					throw error;
				}

				spawn('prettier --write index.html --log-level silent', {
					shell: true,
					stdio: 'inherit'
				});
			});
		});
	});
});
```

Again, you can run this script with `node sprite` at this time the generated sprite will be inserted into the `index.html`, the contents will be formatted and the sprite is completely ready to work!

From now at any time anywhere you can display icons from sprite as follows, just specify the link to the icon name `#bookmark` like. Using attributes you can adjust the size, and you can also apply the fill (if earlier you cut this attribute from the original file using `--stripAttrs`)

``` html
<svg width="1.5em" height="1.5em" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
	<use xlink:href="#bookmark"></use>
</svg>
```
